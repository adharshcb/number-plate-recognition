# Licence Plate Detection

This project uses the YOLOv7 algorithm for license plate detection and EasyOCR for character recognition. The Indian Number Plates dataset from Kaggle was used and manually annotated to ensure high-quality data. The training was done on Google Colab, and the model achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.86.
